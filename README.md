# Weather Dashboard
![Weather Dashboard](/assets/weather.png?raw=true)
This is a web application that accepts a search for any city (either 'city' or 'city, state') in the United States,
and presents the user with the current weather conditions for their chosen city, (including temp, wind speed, humidity,
and UV index) as well as a five day forecast. The UV index changes color if the current index is good (green), moderate (yellow), high (orange),
extremley high (red), or dangerous (purple).
Once a city is searched, it is stored in the user's local storage as a yellow button on the left side of the screen for
easy access in the future.
